# Bootcamp_Final_Project
This code manipulates the image 'Original bilby.png' by:
    1.Converting to greyscale
    2.Resizing
    3.Blurring

The original image (greyscale) is then compared to the blurred version via a greyscale histogram plot. These plots are then analysed for any statistically significant difference. The final product is a blurred, greyscale image resized to 250x250 pixels
